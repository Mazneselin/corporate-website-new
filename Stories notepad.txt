      <h2 id="C1">Children's Stories</h2>
      <div class><img src="children's stories.jpg" style="height:400px; width: 90%;"></div>
      <p>The Three Siblings: Philip’ 5yrs old, ‘John’ 4yrs old, ‘Betty’ 3yrs old. Born to a mentally unstable mother, 
they did not know who their fathers are - their mother was possibly taken advantage by some men who knew she wouldn’t 
be able to identify them for what they have done to her, due to her mental state.</p>

<p>When their mother's mental problems got worse and she could not hold on to her job, their rented home also disappeared as the landlady threw them out in the streets.
They survived by eating leftovers at coffeeshops, hawkers stalls, what they found in garbage bins and finally lived under a flyover.</p>

<p>That was when social welfare found, rescued them and they were placed in Sunbeams Home.
‘Philip’ grew up to become a successful accountant with a leading bank after graduating with honors from a college in the UK.The younger brother ‘John’ was gainfully employed and ‘Betty’ is now happily married.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2 id="C2">Success Stories</h2>
      <div class><img src="sucess.jpg" style="height:400px; width: 80%;"></div>
      <p>We have been encouraged by so many successes achieved by our children who have made all the hard work worthwhile from; sleepless nights of our founder 
	chairman, the GM and the teachers who worry for the children, the strain of finances, enduring the challenges of rehabilitating traumatic young lives. 
	All these efforts have resulted in the children taking the first steps on the road to success.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Christina Santhi has received her Higher Diploma in Business at University Putra.</li>
	<li>Peter Wong Lei Chew secured his honours degree in accounting and finance from the University of Greenwich, UK.</li>
	<li>Simon Lee Yong Cheng represented the state in football.</li>
	<li>Joshua Lim Hang Seng secured his honors degree in Public Relation from Tunku Abdul Rahman University College.</li>
	<li>Titus Liew Kar Meng received his degree in mass communication at UCSI and is currently a drum instructor.</li>
	<li>Rebecca Yong Keng Shen obtained 5 As in her SPM exams and successfully obtain ACCA qualification from Help University.</li>
	<li>David Sam Chun Wai secured his honors degree in International Business from Sunway University.</li>
	<li>Patrick Bah Desa obtained 8 As in the SPM exams and secured his diploma in Business Administration from Sunway University.</li>
	<li>Mary Sam Mee Yee obtained 6 As in the SPM exams and is currently doing a degree program in Psychology at UCSI.</li>
	<li>Michael Phuah Ban Chuen secured his diploma in Animation from The One Academy.</li>
	<li>Aneglica secured her diploma in Fashion Design from Tunku Abdul Rahman University College.</li>
	<li>Harold secured his diploma in Broadcast Communication from Tunku Abdul Rahman University College.</li>
</ul>

	<p>The above are just some of the heart-warming stories of children who found their place in the sun at Sunbeams. We wish there could be more foster homes like Sunbeams set up around the country in order to help these kids find their rightful place in the world.</p>

  <p>Rebecca:</p>
  <p>I remember when I was 6 years old, our world (my sister and I) came tumbling down. Firstly when my father left us and later when my mother told us she had to send
 us to a home as she could not work and look after us at the same time. It was the most frightening news for us. I promised my mom I would look after my sister and do 
all my housework and be a good girl but despite my plea, we ended up in Sunbeams Home. I remember that day so clearly. At the Home, a tall, handsome man named Pastor 
Alvin and a very gentle and kind lady Pastor Lucy assured me that they will be like our parents and the Home will be our family. Rebecca is currently working in an 
accounting firm and aspires to be a chartered accountant.

      <h2 id="C4">Happy Ending Stories</h2>
      <p>Many people have little faith of what would become of these problematic, mentally and physically abused children, tortured by the very blood relatives who were supposed to protect them.</p>
      <p>With unconditional love of their adopted family at Sunbeams, they grew up to be normal people who found their partners for life, got married and for sure, will in turn make sure their 
	children are well cared and protected to the end of time.</p>
